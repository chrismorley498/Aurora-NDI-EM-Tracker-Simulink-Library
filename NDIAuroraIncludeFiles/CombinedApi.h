 * @brief This class encapsulates communication with NDI devices using the Combined API (CAPI).
 * @details This class encapsulates binary and string parsing required to send/receive commands.
 *          This class does not provide an exhaustive implementation of every API call, it does
 *          not implement every option available for some commmands. It is intended as a
 *          supplement to the API guide, with working sample code that compiles and runs cross
 *          platform (Windows/Mac/Linux). Performance concerns were secondary to readability
 *          and portability. Complexities like threading were intentionally avoided.
 *          We hope you will find this sample useful. Happy coding!
